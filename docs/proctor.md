## Our goal: Remote exams with integrity

With remote exams there are many opportunities for cheating. Our goal is to conduct remote exams which have integrity.  
Respondus Monitor had been found not effective in preventing cheating.
**2-device live-proctored exams** have the potential to be effective.
