# 2-device proctored exams

This guide provides instructions for taking proctored exams in courses offered by the UB Math Department. The setup of the exam requires students to use two devices:

* a computer, to access the exam
* a smartphone or tablet equipped with a camera to access an exam Zoom meeting.

Math Department staff members proctor the exams via your smartphone/tablet camera.



# Software installation and setup

## Zoom app

In order to join a proctored exam meeting you will need to have the **Zoom app** installed on your smartphone or tablet.
This app is available for both  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings&hl=en_US)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307) devices.

To access exam Zoom meetings you need to be signed into Zoom
with your UB account. If you are signed in with another account, you can follow these steps to switch to your UB account:

* In the Zoom app, sign out from the non-UB account (go to Settings > My Profile, then scroll down to the bottom).
* Click Sign In and then choose **SSO** where it says "SIGN IN WITH"
* Type ```buffalo``` where it says Enter your company domain.
* On the next screen log in using your UB username and password (Duo will be required for this step).

Here is a [short video](https://ub.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d26e3813-f3d1-4ed7-bae5-ac50012bc2e9){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
demonstrating the above steps.

## Microsoft Office Lens

At the conclusion of the exam you will need to scan pages with your solutions using your phone or tablet, and save the scan as a PDF file.
Install the Microsoft Office Lens scanning app on your smartphone or tablet. The app is available for both  Android and iOS devices.
If needed, refer to the online instructions on how to use Office Lens on Android and iOS.
Practice using this app to create PDF files, in particular learn how to create PDFs consisting on multiple pages.
Here is a short video demonstrating the use of Office Lens.

## Gradescope

Gradescope is where you will be submitting the exam for grading, (and also where you will go to see your score once the exam is graded).
Set up your Gradescope account following the instructions in this guide to Gradescope.
Practice uploading to Gradescope. Your instructor will likely give you a brief assignment for practicing uploading to Gradescope. Make sure you match each page of the file you upload to Gradescope with the appropriate question number.
Here is a short video demonstrating the process of uploading your work to Gradescope and matching pages with questions.
