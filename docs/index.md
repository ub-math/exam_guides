## 2-device proctored exams

This guide provides instructions for taking proctored exams in courses offered by the UB Math Department. The setup of the exam requires students to use two devices:

* a computer, to access the exam
* a smartphone or tablet equipped with a camera to access an exam Zoom meeting.

Math Department staff members proctor the exams via your smartphone/tablet camera.

<br/>

## Software installation and setup

#### Zoom app

In order to join a proctored exam meeting you will need to have the **Zoom app** installed on your smartphone or tablet.
This app is available for both  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings&hl=en_US){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zoom-cloud-meetings/id546505307){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} devices.

To access exam Zoom meetings you need to be signed into Zoom
with your UB account. If you are signed in with another account, you can follow these steps to switch to your UB account:

* In the Zoom app, sign out from the non-UB account (go to Settings > My Profile, then scroll down to the bottom).
* Click Sign In and then choose **SSO** where it says "SIGN IN WITH"
* Type ```buffalo``` where it says Enter your company domain.
* On the next screen log in using your UB username and password (Duo will be required for this step).

demonstrating the above steps.


#### Microsoft Office Lens

At the conclusion of the exam you will need to scan pages with your solutions using your phone or tablet, and save the scan as a PDF file.
Install the Microsoft Office Lens scanning app on your smartphone or tablet. The app is available for both  Android and iOS devices.
If needed, refer to the online instructions on how to use Office Lens on Android and iOS.
Practice using this app to create PDF files, in particular learn how to create PDFs consisting on multiple pages.
Here is a short video demonstrating the use of Office Lens.


#### Gradescope

Gradescope is where you will be submitting the exam for grading, (and also where you will go to see your score once the exam is graded).
Set up your Gradescope account following the instructions in this [guide to Gradescope](https://www.ubgradescope.info/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
Practice uploading to Gradescope. Your instructor will likely give you a brief assignment for practicing uploading to Gradescope.
Make sure you match each page of the file you upload to Gradescope with the appropriate question number.

demonstrating the process of uploading your work to Gradescope and matching pages with questions.


#### The exam PIN

To access the proctored Zoom meeting and the exam questions you will need the exam PIN. You received the PIN in an email from
Prof. John Ringland (ringland@buffalo.edu) on September 10. A few days before the exam make sure that you have the PIN.
If you canâ€™t find it, contact the course instructor. For each Math course you are taking this semester, you will use the same PIN for all exams.  

<p class="text-danger"><b>Important.</b> Keep the exam PIN private. Sharing it with other persons will be considered as an act of Academic Dishonesty  
  and can make you vulnerable to dishonesty by others.</p>

<br/>

## Your exam workspace

#### Workspace setup

Your exam workspace should be in a quiet location with no one else around. Remember: this is an exam you will need to concentrate!


<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-primary">
<h4 class="alert-heading">Here is what you will need to take the exam:</h4>
<ol>
<li>A computer with an internet connection.</li>
<li>A smartphone or tablet with an internet connection, and with Zoom and Office Lens apps installed.
   Make sure that your device is fully charged or it is connected to a charger.</li>
<li>A Gradescope account.</li>
<li>UB student ID (or a government issued photo ID).</li>
<li>Your exam PIN.</li>
<li>Pen or pencil.</li>
<li>Blank paper.</li>
<li>Desk or table clear of any items, besides those listed above.</li>
</ol>
</div>


During the exam, you are **not allowed** to use any calculators or consult any references (e.g. cheat sheets, formula sheets, note cards,
textbooks, websites, etc) unless it is specified otherwise by the course instructor. Also, you must not wear headphones or earbuds.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2">
            <p>Your Zoom device must use the front-facing (selfie) camera for the Zoom meeting (so that the screen is facing towards you).
            Additionally, it must be positioned in the landscape mode and tilted so that Zoom receives a clear view of:

            <ul>
            <li> your computer screen and keyboard (and mouse if any) </li>
            <li> your face and your hands </li>
            <li> your writing surface and the papers you are writing on. </li>
            </ul>

            For most phones, this will require the phone to be a little more than arm's length away. You may need to arrange another support
            for the phone if your desk is not big enough - get creative!

## Setup Guide

### Create a repository from this template

[Go to this repository page on Github](https://github.com/nicolas-van/bootstrap-4-github-pages) and click the `Use this template` button on the top right of the page.

### Choose a name for your repository

Here we have two possibilities:

* **You want a user or organization website**

  In this case your website's URL will be `http://<your username>.github.io` where `<your username>` is your Github user name.

  Choose the repository name `<your username>.github.io`.

* **You want a project website**

  In this case your website's URL will be `http://<your username>.github.io/<whatever you want>` where `<whatever you want>` can be any valid name for a Github repository.

  Choose the repository name `<whatever you want>`.

### Activate Github Pages on your repository

Go in the `Settings` page of your repository, in the `Github Pages`, under the `Source` parameter, choose `master branch` then `Save`.

### That's it

Your Github Pages website with customizable Bootstrap 4 is now up and running, you can access it using the URL displayed by Github in the `Github Pages` settings.

## Customization Guide

### Modify the configuration

You should at least edit the `_config.yml` file to edit your website's metadata, like the title, description and repository URL.

### Change your theme

This website uses the [Minty](https://bootswatch.com/minty/) Bootstrap theme by default. And you don't want to use the same theme everyone else uses do you?

You can of course modify anything in the `_includes`, `_layouts` and `_sass` folders to customize both the HTML or CSS of your website, possibly referring to the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/) or the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/) when needed. This is a normal part of web development and it is outside the scope of this guide.

But if you don't know where to start I can recommend you to import a theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

* Go on [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and choose a theme that you like.
* Using the top bar, download its `_variables.scss` and `_bootswatch.scss` files.
* Copy the content of `_variables.scss` in `_sass/_variables.scss`.
* Copy the content of `_bootswatch.scss` in `_sass/_bootstrap_customization.scss`.

That's it, you now have a totally different appearance for you website.

### Modify the content

You probably don't want the present guide to be the front page of your website, so you should edit the `index.md` file. You probably also want to edit or delete the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md` and `LICENSE.md` files.

Aside from that you can of course create new pages and posts like with any Jekyll website by refering to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Run Jekyll on your computer to speed up testing

Editing your website's content or theme directly on Github is completely possible but, due to the time Github Pages takes to update your website, it will probably be much more effective to work using a local Jekyll installation.

To do so:

* Install the [requirements for Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
* Type `bundle install` at the root of your project to install the necessary Ruby dependencies.
* Type `bundle exec jekyll serve` to launch the test Jekyll web server that will re-compile your work if you edit it.
* You can then open `http://localhost:4000` in your web browser to see your work-in-progress website.

Please note that, to ensure maximum compatibility with Github Pages, the `Gemfile` of this project references the `github-pages` gem, not Jekyll directly. This implies some differences in behavior compared to the official documentation of Jekyll.

## Known issues

* Bootstrap 4 should normally be post-processed using [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). Even if it is possible to use autoprefixer with Jekyll, it is not possible with a classic Github Pages installation without adding some kind of pre-processing before publication. Since this project mostly aims compatibility with Github Pages I prefer to keep it that way. The consequences of this choice is that some Bootstrap features could not work as expected on older browsers.
